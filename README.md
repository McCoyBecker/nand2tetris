# nand2tetris - building a modern computer from first principles
A repository for projects from Elements of Computing Systems by Noam Nissan and Shimon Shocken. The idea behind this book is to teach computer architecture and systems programming by constructing a full computing system on your own computer.

## current status
I've completed Ch. 1 through Ch.5. Currently working on constructing the assembler in Ch.6.
